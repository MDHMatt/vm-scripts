## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Laptop running proxmox not picking up USB3 to Eth adaptor running the realtek r8153 firmware. this script will unbind and rebind the onbard usb hub so that it forces the system to find the usb adaptor. This is so that should a remote reboot be needed a phisical removal and reinsertion of the device isnt needed.

#### Caution must be made to ensure no mounted data drives are connected are needed during this script.

The script fires once proxmox has loaded.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to find the usb root hub ID which can be found by following the guide found here (https://zedt.eu/tech/linux/restarting-usb-subsystem-centos/ )

copied below incase site dies
```
In cases like this, Linux (unlike Windows) can trigger a USB subsystem restart by deactivating and reactivating the USB controller(s).

The hardware ID(s) of the controllers differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and from hardware to hardware. So the first thing to do is find out the correct hardware ID(s).

Running

cd /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd
ls

returns a list of one or more controller IDs, in the form of 0000:00:xx.y.

Edit: For USB 3.0 controllers, use instead

cd /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd
ls

On my system which has two AMD USB controllers, the following IDs are found:

0000:00:12.2  0000:00:13.2  bind  module  new_id  remove_id  uevent  unbind

Now that the ID or IDs are known, you need to run a set of commands that trigger the disabling and re-enabling of that device. You can run this command for a specific controller (if you know which one) or for all controllers if you don‚Äôt have anything critical connected to the USB. The command is:

echo -n "0000:00:xx.y" > unbind

Remember to enable them back:

echo -n "0000:00:xx.y" > bind

where instead of xx.y you fill in the correct set of numbers to use the IDs discovered above.
```

### üöÄ Installing  <a name="deployment">

Copy the `usbup.sh` file to a location on the proxmox host and make it exicutable with `chmod +x`

Copy the `restart-usb.service` systemd service file to

`/etc/systemd/system/`

adjust the `ExecStart` location to point ot the location of the `upusb.sh` file.

check that it will run

`sudo systemctl start restart-usb.service`

and make it start on boot.

`sudo systemctl enable restart-usb.service`

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Code will run on reboot once the proxmox service has started.
